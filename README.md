# ðŸ§¬ MutantSim â€” Protein Outcomes Under Biased Polymerase Errors

## ðŸ“– What does this project do?
MutantSim is a Python tool that takes an **mRNA coding sequence (CDS)** and a **mutation bias matrix** for an error-prone polymerase, and estimates the effects on the resulting protein.  

> In simple words:  
> You give the program a gene sequence and the error rates of the viral polymerase, and it tells you:  
> â€¢ what % of proteins will stay unchanged  
> â€¢ what % will carry amino acid changes  
> â€¢ how often premature stop codons appear  
> â€¢ what happens in any region of interest you choose  

This can be useful for:
- Understanding how mutation bias affects protein stability  
- Exploring **regions of interest** within a gene  
- Building intuition about error-prone amplification in virology or synthetic biology

## ðŸ§¾ Inputs
1. **FASTA file** â€” mRNA sequence starting at `AUG` and ending at a stop codon (CDS only).  
2. **Bias matrix (CSV)** â€” a 4Ã—4 table of base substitution probabilities per round.  
   - Header: `A,C,G,U`  
   - Rows: A, C, G, U  
   - Each row must sum to ~1.0.  
3. **Rounds** â€” how many amplification cycles to simulate (integer).  
4. **Optional region (nt positions)** â€” a range like `300-600` to check mutation risk in that part of the sequence.

## ðŸ“¤ Outputs (V1)
- ðŸ§¾ **Sequence length** (nt)  
- ðŸ”  **Protein product (no mutations)** â€” original translation  
- ðŸ§© **Codon count** (number of codons in CDS)  
- âœ… **% unchanged protein** (no amino acid changes at all)  
- ðŸ“Š **Distribution of k nonsilent mutations** (probability of 0,1,2â€¦ codons changing)  
- â›” **% premature STOP codon** (protein truncated early)  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Region of interest** â€” probability of â‰¥1 nonsilent mutation in the specified region  

All results are printed in the terminal (future versions will also produce nice HTML/plots ðŸ“ˆ).
